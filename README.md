# iOS-App-Development

## All Apps are clone built from Udemy Course that I have gone through up to this point.

### DiceApp
![DiceApp Image](https://i.imgur.com/QidjRno.png){:style="float: right}
- Random Dice Generator.
- Instead of using "arch4random". Swift 4 has implemented "Int.random(in: 0...5)"
- Learned
 - To write clean code, packaging code into functions to be used everywhere else. 
 - DRY ( Don't Repeat Yourself).
 - Design Structures.

### Magic 8Ball
- Same concept as DiceApp.
- Instead of having 2 UIImageViews to be generated had only 1 view to randomly generate. 
- DRY Concept.

### Xylophone
- Import AVFoundation and used AVAudioPlayer to play sounds.
- Learned to use "sender-tags" to control multiple buttons attached to array.
- Learned the "do-catch-try" method to throw errors if the code doesn't work.

### Quizzler
- Learned to incorporate Objective-C into Swift project
- Learned MVC
- Lerned to manage files correctly and have seperate files tied together.

### Destini
- Worked with story lines to engage with users
- Better understanding of using the sender.tag when selecting a button.


## Random Projects For Better Practice

### Auto-Layout-Practice
- Learned and built with auto constraints to be able to work with all devices.
- Learned that sometimes with iPhone X design you might need to add a 'SuperView' with a constraint of 0 to make the view all the way down with no gap.

## Random Playgrounds

### Love Calculator
- Built with a simple func see what your love score with someone is.

### BMI Calculator
- Built with a simple func to display your BMI
